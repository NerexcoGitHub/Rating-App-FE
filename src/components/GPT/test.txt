"Certainly! Here's a code snippet in Java to find the sum of 10 numbers:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter 10 numbers:");
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.print("Number " + (i+1) + ": ");
            int number = scanner.nextInt();
            sum += number;
        }

        System.out.println("Sum of the numbers is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

In this code, we use a for loop to iterate 10 times and prompt the user to enter a number in each iteration. The numbers are then added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the sum is printed to the console."


"Certainly! Here's the code snippet modified to generate HTML code to display the output:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter 10 numbers:");
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.print("Number " + (i+1) + ": ");
            int number = scanner.nextInt();
            sum += number;
        }

        String htmlCode = "<html>\n" +
                "<head>\n" +
                "<title>Sum of Numbers</title>\n" +
                "</head>\n" +
                "<body>\n" +
                "<h1>Sum of the 10 numbers is:</h1>\n" +
                "<p>" + sum + "</p>\n" +
                "</body>\n" +
                "</html>";
                
        System.out.println(htmlCode);
    }
}
```

This code will generate an HTML code string that displays the sum of the 10 numbers as the output. You can copy the generated HTML code and place it in an HTML file or use it in your desired context."

"Sure! Here's an example of HTML code to show a text box:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Text Box Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form>
        <label for="textbox">Enter your name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="textbox" name="name"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a `<form>` tag that contains a `<label>` for the text box and an `<input>` element with `type="text"` to create the text box. The `id` attribute on the `<input>` element helps to uniquely identify the text box, and the `name` attribute specifies the name of the input field, which is used when submitting the form data. The `<br>` tags are for line breaks, and the last `<input>` element with `type="submit"` is a button to submit the form."
